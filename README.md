# Telecommunication-Insights-Dashboard-using-Tableau

OBJECTIVE:-
The objective of this project is to provide comprehensive insights into the operations of a telecommunications call center through an interactive Tableau dashboard. This dashboard aims to analyze key metrics such as call volume, handling times, customer satisfaction, and agent performance. By visualizing these data points, the dashboard facilitates data-driven decision-making, helping stakeholders identify trends, optimize resources, and improve overall service quality. This project underscores the power of data visualization in transforming raw data into actionable insights, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and customer experience.

INTRODUCTION:-

In the fast-paced telecommunications industry, understanding the dynamics of call center operations is crucial for maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. This project presents a comprehensive Telecommunications Insights Dashboard created using Tableau, designed to analyze and visualize key performance metrics from a telecommunications call center. By leveraging advanced data visualization techniques, this dashboard provides a clear and interactive view of the call center's performance, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on real-time data.

The dashboard encompasses various aspects of call center operations, including call volume trends, average handling times, customer satisfaction scores, and agent performance metrics. It aims to uncover insights that can help identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation, and enhance the overall customer service experience. This project highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in the telecommunications sector and demonstrates the value of transforming raw data into meaningful visual insights.

DATA SOURCE:-

The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle, a well-known platform for data science and machine learning competitions.

DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION:-

The raw dataset from Kaggle required several cleaning and preparation steps to ensure the data was accurate and ready for analysis. The following steps were taken:

Handling Missing Values: 
Missing values were identified and addressed by either filling them with appropriate statistical measures (e.g., mean, median) or removing rows/columns with a significant number of missing entries.

Data Type Conversion: 
Ensured all columns had the correct data types (e.g., dates as date types, numerical values as integers or floats).

Outlier Detection and Removal: 
Outliers in the data, which could skew the analysis, were detected and appropriately handled by either removing them or capping them.

Normalization and Scaling: 
Certain features were normalized or scaled to ensure consistency and comparability across different metrics.

Feature Engineering:
New features were created to enhance the analysis, such as calculating call handling time per agent and deriving customer satisfaction scores based on feedback.

Data Aggregation:
Data was aggregated at various levels (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) to facilitate different types of analysis and visualizations.

FEATURES AND METRICS:-

The dashboard includes a variety of features and metrics that provide a comprehensive view of call center operations:

Call Volume:

Total Number of Calls: The total count of calls handled over a specified period.
Call Volume Trends: Analysis of call volume trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
Handling Times

Average Handling Time (AHT): 
The average time taken to handle a call.
Handling Time Distribution: Distribution of call handling times to identify common duration ranges.
Customer Satisfaction

Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT): 
Scores derived from customer feedback after interactions.
CSAT Trends: Trends in customer satisfaction scores over time.
Agent Performance

Agent Call Volume:
Number of calls handled by each agent.
Average Handling Time per Agent: The average handling time for each agent.
Agent CSAT: Customer satisfaction scores attributed to each agent.
Service Level

Call Abandonment Rate:
The percentage of calls that were abandoned before being answered.
Call Transfer Rate: The percentage of calls transferred to another agent or department.

INSIGHTS AND FINDINGS:-
1.Call Volume Trends
2.Handling Times
3.Customer Satisfaction
4.Agent Performance
5.Service Level Compliance
6.Operational Metrics
7.Resource Allocation

CONCLUSION:-
The Telecommunications Insights Dashboard offers valuable insights into call center operations, enabling data-driven decisions to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction. Key findings highlight the need for optimized staffing during peak times, targeted agent training, and improved call routing strategies. By identifying trends and best practices, the dashboard supports continuous improvement in service quality. This project demonstrates the power of data visualization in transforming raw data into actionable insights, helping the call center stay competitive and efficient in the telecommunications industry.
